# Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning

This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning models to detect fake news from text data. It is developed as part of the **Naan Mudhalvan** program.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this project is to classify news articles as either **REAL** or **FAKE** based on their content. The models used include:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- NumPy
- TfidfVectorizer
- Google Colab

## 🗃️ Dataset

The dataset consists of text samples with corresponding labels: `"REAL"` or `"FAKE"`. You can find a sample dataset in `dataset.csv`.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Upload `dataset.csv` in your working directory.
2. Run the script `fake_news_detection.py` in a Python environment or Google Colab.
3. The output will show classification performance using both Random Forest and SVM.

## 📊 Output

- Accuracy score
- Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
